# Examples of classes and instances of classes

## Analogy 

# A class is a blueprint (like an architectural plan for a house).
# An instance is a built house â€” a specific object created from that plan.
# You can build many houses (instances) from the same blueprint (class), but each one can have different features (data).

class Employee:      # This is a class, it's a blueprint (like an architectural plan for a house)
    pass

emp1 = Employee()       # This is an instance of a class. emp1 is an instance variable (in comparison to a class variable).
emp2 = Employee()       # This is a different instance of a class

print(emp1)
print(emp2)

emp1.first = 'Cory'
emp1.last = 'Smith'
emp1.email = 'cory.smith@gmail.com'
emp1.pay = 50000

emp2.first = 'Test'
emp2.last = 'User'
emp2.email = 'test.user@gmail.com'
emp2.pay = 60000

# Now each of these instances have attributes that are unique to them

print(emp1.email)
print(emp2.email)

# What we have done here is manually set these variables every time, but this is 
# a lot of effort, and that's where classes come in, where we can set up
# these variables automatically when we create the employee

class Employee:    
    def __init__(self): # all classes and functions need a colon
        pass
    
    
# when we create methods (functions within classes), they recieve the instance as
# the first argument automatically. By conention we call this self. 
# self will just be the name of the instance

class Employee:    
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay): # all classes and functions need a colon
        self.first = first  # Creates the variable first. It is assigned to the instance self, and will take the value first as input into the instance
        self.last = last
        self.pay = pay
        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@gmail.com'
    
# Now to create out instances we just input the variables either in order, or 
# by writing first = 'Cory'. 
# Note that the instance is passed automatically so that we can leave off self
# What this means is emp1 will be passed in as self
    
emp1 = Employee('Cory', 'Smith', 50000)       # This is an instance of a class. emp1 is an instance variable (in comparison to a class variable).
# emp2 = Employee()            
# This produced an error when it was ran. We initialised it, therefore requiring 
# that the arguments 'first', 'last' and 'pay' are entered. 
# If we hadn't initialised it, it would have been fine




# Now going to create a method to display full name
class Employee:    
    def __init__(self, first, last, pay): # all classes and functions need a colon
        self.first = first  # Creates the variable first. It is assigned to the instance self, and will take the value first as input into the instance

        self.email = first + '.' + last + '@gmail.com'
        
    def fullname(self):
        return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)
    
# I got the error AttributeError: 'Employee' object has no attribute 'fullname'
# This was because I defined the instance before editing the class
# You must always create the instance after you create the class

# Note that you shouldn't refer to a instance without referring to which class it is from
emp1= Employee('Cory', 'Smith', 50000)
    
# Now the class of employees all have an associated 'fullname' method
# This method can only be used in reference to an instance of the class
# Therefore we call the instance first, and then call which method we want to use from the class
print(emp1.fullname())

# is going on behind the scenes
# When you do this you have to manually pass in the instance as an argument
